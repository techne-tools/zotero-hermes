## Governance Docs (read first)

These documents govern all work in this repo. Read them before planning or
implementing:

| Doc | Role |
|---|---|
| `DESIGN.md` | **Design north star** — target state. Every design decision is measured against it. |
| `PRODUCT.md` | **Product intent** — what the plugin is for, who it serves, what it is not. |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | **Current code reality** — how the code is actually structured today. |
| `.agent/rules/agent-standards.md` | **Agent contract** — sandbox constraints, security rules, code quality, worktree discipline. |

**Conflict rule:** when docs and code disagree, FLAG the conflict — do not
silently pick a side. Keep verifiable claims (test counts, file lists) in
these docs current at review time.

## Development Notes

### Zotero Sandbox Constraints (Critical)

Zotero plugins run in a **Firefox 115 ESR sandbox** with severe React limitations:

1. **Synthetic events fail** — `onChange`, `onClick`, `onKeyDown` on React elements don't fire
   - **Pattern**: Use native `addEventListener` via refs for ALL user interaction
   - **Example**: `textareaRef.current.addEventListener("keydown", handler)` instead of `onKeyDown`

2. **State ref pattern** — Native callbacks can't access React state closures
   - **Pattern**: `stateRef` mirrors all React state; native handlers read from `stateRef.current`
   - **Example**: `const st = stateRef.current; if (st.isTyping) return;`

3. **No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** — Crashes the sandbox with security errors
   - **Pattern**: Use `MarkdownRenderer.tsx` — pure React element creation from parsed markdown
   - **No `DOMParser` either** — also crashes; manual string parsing only

4. **Clipboard access** — Use Firefox XPCOM `nsIClipboardHelper`
   - **Pattern**: `(Components as any).classes["@mozilla.org/widget/clipboardhelper;1"].getService(...)`

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### Dual-Mode Connection

- **ACP (stdio)** — Spawns `hermes acp` subprocess, JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio/NDJSON
- **API (HTTP)** — REST client to `hermes gateway`, SSE streaming, OpenAI-compatible format
- Both implement `ChatClient` interface; UI is agnostic

#### Stream Subscription Pattern

- `useEffect` subscribes to `client.onUpdate()` and `client.onError()`
- Minimal deps array to avoid re-subscription loops
- Callbacks use refs (`streamingMessageIdRef`, `reasoningMessageIdRef`) for mutable state

#### Buffered Streaming

- `useStreamBuffer` collects rapid chunks and flushes via `setTimeout(flushBuffer, 50)`
- Replaced `requestAnimationFrame` (unreliable in sandbox) with `setTimeout`
- Reasoning messages inserted BEFORE assistant message via `splice(assistantIndex, 0, reasoningMsg)`

#### Typing Indicator Safety

- 60-second timeout started when `sendPrompt` is called
- Reset on every non-terminal update chunk; restarted in `handleUpdate`
- Terminal events: `stop`, `usage`, `session_info`, `error`
- Prevents stuck "Hermes is thinking" when stream never terminates

#### Stop Button Wiring

- The send button doubles as a stop button — it shows `StopIcon` while `isTyping` is true
- Its native `click` handler reads `stateRef.current.isTyping` (not React state) to decide:
  - If typing → calls `client.cancel()` to abort the in-flight stream
  - If idle → calls `sendMessage()` as normal
- `cancel()` is implemented on both `HermesClient` (kills subprocess stdin) and `HermesApiClient` (aborts `AbortController`)

### Item Context Resolution

**Critical**: Zotero parent items and attachments have **different keys**.

- Parent item (book, article) has key `ABC123`
- PDF attachment is a **child item** with its own key `XYZ789`
- Storage folder is `~/Zotero/storage/XYZ789/` (attachment key, NOT parent key)
- `ItemManager.extractItemData()` is **async** — it `await`s `item.getBestAttachment()` to resolve the real attachment (the Zotero API returns a Promise; the old sync cast was silently broken)
- Passes `attachmentKey` and `storagePath` in context so agent finds the correct folder

### Agent Context Format

When items are attached, the agent receives:

```
[item]: Technical gadgetry: technological development in the aesthetic economy
Title: Technical gadgetry: technological development in the aesthetic economy
Authors: John Doe, Jane Smith
Date: 2024
Abstract: This paper explores...
Tags: technology, aesthetics, economy
DOI: 10.1234/example
URL: https://example.com/paper
Item type: journalArticle
Zotero attachment key: XYZ789
Zotero storage path: /Users/<user>/Zotero/storage/XYZ789/
Zotero file path: /Users/<user>/Zotero/storage/XYZ789/filename.pdf
```

The system instruction explicitly tells the agent:

- "The metadata for attached Zotero items is ALREADY provided"
- "ANSWER DIRECTLY using the provided metadata"
- "Do NOT search online, do NOT try to read the SQLite database"

This prevents hallucinations about database access or online searches.

### MCP Removal

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration was attempted but consistently failed:

- Connection refused errors
- "Invalid params" format mismatches
- Wrapper scripts didn't resolve the issue

**Decision**: Removed MCP dependency entirely. Agent uses provided metadata directly.

- `createSession()` sends `mcpServers: []`
- System instruction explicitly states MCP is unavailable
- All Zotero data comes from attached context items

### Worktree Development (Test-Fix Workflows)

When fixing tests or doing isolated work, use a **git worktree** — never run tests against a dirty main tree. These gotchas were harvested from the 2026-08-11 markdown parser fix (see FLEET.md Q10–Q13):

1. **Branch from the last building commit, not clean main** — clean `main` can be build-broken (e.g. `src/hooks.ts` importing a symbol that only exists on an in-flight branch). Verify the base ref builds before creating the worktree, or re-point with `git reset --hard <building-commit>`.

2. **Copy the gitignored `.env`** — the scaffold loads it via dotenv; without it you get "No Zotero Found." It contains:
   ```
   ZOTERO_PLUGIN_ZOTERO_BIN_PATH = /Applications/Zotero.app/Contents/MacOS/zotero
   ZOTERO_PLUGIN_PROFILE_PATH = /Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/<profile>.default
   ```

3. **`NODE_ENV=test` is mandatory for `npm ci`** — ambient `NODE_ENV=production` (Hermes TUI quirk) makes npm 11 omit devDependencies (only 6 packages installed otherwise). Always prefix: `NODE_ENV=test npm ci --no-audit --no-fund`.

4. **Headless Zotero teardown lingers** — the suite result appears in the log BEFORE the process exits. Run tests backgrounded, read the log for the result, then kill the process. Don't wait for exit.

5. **Never stash a dirty tree to run tests** — the test build regenerates `typings/prefs.d.ts` (tracked, ~10 deletions), which blocks a stash pop. Commit to a task branch first, then run tests.

6. **opencode sandbox blocks `/tmp` writes** — dispatch briefs must say "work only inside this worktree, no /tmp paths". Also: exit 0 is UNVERIFIED — gate on `git diff` + TASK.md status, not just the exit code.

### Test Runner Gotchas (2026-08-12 — unit test suite)

These cost a full debugging session. Read before writing tests that touch the `Zotero` global:

1. **`zotero-plugin test` runs in WATCH mode by default** — the process never exits after tests finish. Always run `npm test -- --no-watch` (or `--exit-on-finish`) for CI/verification runs. Without it, the suite "hangs" after the last test.

2. **NEVER replace the `Zotero` global in tests** — the test runner's reporter calls `Zotero.HTTP.request` to stream results back to the server, and `Zotero.Utilities.Internal.quit` to exit. Replacing `globalThis.Zotero` with a mock breaks the reporter: every `send()` throws, the server never receives the "end" event, and the suite hangs forever with no error output. **Pattern**: spread-overlay the real object and override only what you need:
   ```ts
   const realZotero = (globalThis as any).Zotero;
   (globalThis as any).__realZotero = realZotero;
   (globalThis as any).Zotero = { ...realZotero, getProfileDirectory: () => ... };
   // restore in after(): (globalThis as any).Zotero = (globalThis as any).__realZotero;
   ```

3. **`Components` is a read-only global in the Firefox sandbox** — you cannot reassign `globalThis.Components`. The real one already provides `nsIFile.DIRECTORY_TYPE`, so don't mock it.

4. **Some `Zotero.File` properties are read-only** (e.g. `putContents`, `getContents`) — direct assignment throws. Use the spread-overlay pattern above instead.

5. **Chai assertion errors lose their message in the reporter** — the scaffold's reporter serializes `data.error` via JSON, and chai's `message` is non-enumerable, so failures show as `Expected: undefined / Received: undefined`. To debug, wrap the test body in try/catch and call `(window as any).debug?.(err.stack)` (the scaffold defines `window.debug` which POSTs to the server).

6. **Mock `Zotero.File.pathToFile` must throw on empty path** — `ConversationManager` relies on that throw to skip persistence when no profile/data dir exists. A mock that silently accepts `""` will write files with empty paths and break the "no persist" test.

7. **`nsIFile.isDirectory` is a boolean PROPERTY, not a method** — `dirFile.isDirectory` (no parens). Calling it as `isDirectory()` throws "is not a function" at runtime. The M1 regression test (loadAllConversations with a populated dir) caught this in the original implementation — it had never run against a populated directory before.

### Zotero 10 Compatibility (10 September 2026)

Zotero 10.0.2 runs on **Mozilla 140.15.0esr** (was 115 ESR in Zotero 9). The
plugin was blocked by `strict_max_version: "9.*"` (`appDisabled: True` in
extensions.json). Fixes landed on branch `feat/zotero-10-compat`:

| File                                 | Change                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `addon/manifest.json`                | `strict_max_version` → `10.*`                                          |
| `zotero-plugin.config.ts`            | esbuild target `firefox115` → `firefox140`                             |
| `package.json`                       | scaffold `^0.9.2`, zotero-types `^4.1.3`, toolkit `^5.2.0`             |
| `src/utils/ztoolkit.ts`              | `ZoteroToolkit` import → `zotero-plugin-toolkit/ztoolkit` subpath (5.2.0 breaking change) |
| `src/modules/hermes/NoteManager.ts`  | `getAsync` now returns `Item \| false` in zotero-types 4.1.3 — widen declared type |

Gotchas learned:

1. **Zotero 10 = Firefox 140 ESR** — esbuild 0.28 supports `firefox140`; the
   old `firefox115` target still compiles but is stale. Raise it with the
   version bump.
2. **toolkit 5.2.0 moved `ZoteroToolkit` to `/ztoolkit`** — root export removed
   (breaking change, 2026-07-21). Other tools (`BasicTool`, `UITool`,
   `DialogHelper`, `ColumnOptions`, `unregister`) stay at root.
3. **zotero-types 4.1.3 tightened `Zotero.Items.getAsync`** to `Item | false`
   (changelog: "missing `| false` returns"). Guard code that already checked
   `if (!note)` needs the declared variable type widened to compile.
4. **scaffold 0.9.2 (2026-09-08) fixes the chai error-serialization gotcha** —
   the fail reporter now serializes `error.message`/`stack` explicitly. The
   `window.debug` workaround in gotcha #5 above is no longer needed for
   debugging failures.
5. **`npm ci` fails after version bumps** — lock file must be regenerated with
   `NODE_ENV=test npm install` first (EUSAGE: "lock file's X does not satisfy Y").
6. **Test run consumes the built XPI** — `zotero-plugin test` installs the
   addon dir directly and the `.scaffold/build/*.xpi` disappears. Rebuild with
   `NODE_ENV=production npm run build` before installing into a profile.
